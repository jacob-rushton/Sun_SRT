# Sun_SRT
Using data from a Small Radio Telescope to calculate the solar flux density of the Sun

the file "read_srt.py" is a Python package that allows for easy use and manipulation of the rad file created by the Small Radio Telescope (SRT), and is necessary to import for the main script to work. 

The rad file contains all sorts of data from the SRT including the azimuth and elevation of the SRT at each measurement, and the associated azimuth and elevation offsets.
